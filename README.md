# League-of-Legends-App

![platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-python-brightgreen.svg)

This is the python version of my League of Legends Java App. It allows users to access data on their League of Legends account 
without logging into the main client. Using the info gathered from the Riot API, visual graphs are created to make the data easier 
to comprehend.

## Features
- Login system
- Look at recent match History
- Search for other users in varying regions
- Calculates MMR

## Requirements
- Python 3.0+
- Tkinter

## Bugs/Limitations
1. MMR calculations only work if recent match is a rank game.
2. User search is case sensitive.
